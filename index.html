  Beating Capsim Simulation: Master Guide
</header>
<hr>
<p>This guide is a synthesis of all the worthwhile material floating around the net on the subject along with my own insights, and is what my team followed to beat our 2018 undergraduate class with a $620mil lead, crippling 2 teams into bankruptcy, with 1 limping at break-even and second place trailing far behind at $30m. Needless to say, the class curve was brutal.</p>

<p>Be advised, this isn't a cheat code to beating the game. You're not playing against computers. Introducing other players to the game puts it on a level of complexity no AI could follow. Just like Hold 'em, there is Basic Perfect Strategy you can (and should) learn and follow whose correct odds will grant you a mechanical edge over suckers, but to win consistently you need to learn the in's and out's of the game AND your opponents - how to read them, how to respond to them, how to out-maneuver them. Predicting your opponent is an artform that relies more on intuition than math. And no plan survives contact with the enemy.</p>

<p>That said, this will you give you a strong edge, and teach you the mindset you need to be in to dominate your class. Some people seem to think it's unfair or a form of cheating to use guides like this. There is no fair in business and grey-areas are always game. Business is war and you have no business jumping in the fray if you don't understand that. You'll get eaten alive. We taught a valuable lesson to the rest of our class - uni tried babying them from the real world, but they would've paid for it in spades later. Hopefully they took notes. If you've found yourself here, it means you know how to perform basic due diligence - this is market research - and chances are your competition hasn't. Let's see some blood.</p>


<p>Basic introduction to Capstone System</p>

<p>TOC</p>

  <h2><a id="Principles_0"></a>Principles</h2>
  <ol>

    <li>Stay consistent. Develop a strategy and stick with it.</li>
    <li>Always try to read the competition’s strategy.</li>
    <li>Never ignore competition’s behavior in your forecasting. Always ignore the Computer Forecast.</li>
    <li>Invest early, profit later. Early investment produces compounded returns.</li>
    <li>Borrow aggressively. Students are timid with debt because they don't understand it, but businesses need investment to generate value. </li>
    <li>Aim for domination. Take over the market by grabbing multiple segments, choking revenue from other teams.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
And this goes without saying but read, read and re-read the provided Team Members Guide. All essential information is provided. You'll be surprised how many dumb mistakes are made because teams looked over something in the manual. Call the 1-800 number for any clarifications. You can also just review my notes on it here.</p>

<p>And of course, read and understand the generated Industry Conditions report at the beginning of the simulation and the annual Courier Report each round. These detail all the conditions of your class's unique simulation and market.</p>
  <h2><a id="Rules_of_Thumb_9"></a>Rules of Thumb</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Long-term loans are better than short term loans. Long-term debts expire after 10 years, while the simulation ends at 8; you only pay interest on long-term debts.</li>
    <li>Be careful of emergency loans and spending too much at once. Leave yourself a small buffer - but don’t just sit on cash; reinvest most of it.</li>
    <li>Too much inventory is better than stocking out in terms of scoring.</li>
    <li>Aim for 100% Accessibility and 100% Awareness on every product.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2><a id="Recommended_Team_Breakdown_16"></a>Recommended Team Breakdown</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>CEO: overview of all departments, final decision maker</li>
    <li>Marketing Manager: Sales &amp; Production Forecasting; Price Management</li>
    <li>Product Manager: Capacity following Production Forecasting; R&amp;D positioning;</li>
    <li>Competitive Intelligence Officer: Analyzing and Predicting behavior of the competition</li>
    <li>Financial Analyst</li>
  </ol>
  <h2><a id="Research__Development_25"></a>Research &amp; Development</h2>
  <p>Understand what the sensor market wants and have the best products. Your guide will tell you what the customer wants.</p>
  <p>Balance R&amp;D, with proper forecasting, with researching new products. You can back off automation a bit if you run out of money. Ramping up TQM to get 47% R&amp;D reduction is key,</p>
  <p>Analyze and forecast the product drift and complete R&amp;D at the ideal spot by round 7. For low-end, R&amp;D is not relevant as long as you stay within the circle of product desirability.</p>
  <h3><a id="MBTF_33"></a>MBTF</h3>
  <p>Lower MBTF in Low/Tradition to the lowest acceptable limit.</p>
  <h3><a id="Upgrade_Timing_36"></a>Upgrade Timing</h3>
  <p>Keep product R&amp;D upgrades within in the same year or you will miss out on significant sales. Sensors will continue to produce and sell at the old specifications up until the project completes (revision date). Unsold sensors built prior to the revision date are reworked free of charge to match the upgraded specifications.</p>
  <p>You want to increase performance and reduce size as much as you can without the revision date hitting June 28.</p>
  <h2><a id="Production_41"></a>Production</h2>
  <p>Check production page each round and make sure margins are over 30% for every product.</p>
  <h3><a id="Production_Schedule_44"></a>Production Schedule</h3>
  <p>((Units Sales Forecasted) * (1.2) – Inventory on Hand))</p>
  <h3><a id="Automation_47"></a>Automation</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Low End: you want to reach 10 as soon as possible (first round you can move to 8 or 9, and make sure you have 10 by the 2nd round)</li>
    <li>Traditional: increase automation by 2 points each round until you reach 10</li>
    <li>High End: increase by 0.5 or 1 point each round, you do not want to go over 6.</li>
    <li>Performance: increase by 1 or 1.5 each round, until you reach 7</li>
    <li>Size: increase by 0.5 or 1 point each round, until you reach 7</li>
  </ul>
  <h3><a id="BuySell_Capacity_54"></a>Buy/Sell Capacity</h3>
  <p>If 2nd-shift capacity is over 50%, buy more capacity. If it is under 20%, sell capacity.</p>
  <p>After you make you decisions on production, check how much capital investment you have. If you have capital investment leftover, try to spend it in Automation or Capacity. If you are spending more than you should, try to sell capacity or not invest as much.</p>
  <h3><a id="New_Products_59"></a>New Products</h3>
  <p>Introduce products in high end, performance, and size starting round 3. New products rob your opponents of market share. Traditional &amp; low-end are not focused due to automation and capacity requirements.</p>
  <h2><a id="Marketing_62"></a>Marketing</h2>
  <h3><a id="Pricing_64"></a>Pricing</h3>
  <p>For traditional you want to start your pricing as close as your competition, undercut if possible.</p>
  <p>For low end, you have to have the lowest price you can afford without going below 40% in your contribution margin. And without sacrificing demand.</p>
  <p>For high end, performance and size segments, place your price the highest possible.</p>
  <h3><a id="Marketing_Budget_71"></a>Marketing Budget</h3>
  <p>Target 100% awareness. Keep marketing pushed high until you hit it.</p>
  <p>$2000 is the promotions sweet spot. After $2000 you hit diminishing returns.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Round when the product is launched – $1700</li>
    <li>Subsequent rounds till awareness reaches 100% –  $2000</li>
    <li>After awareness reaches 100% – $1400 to maintain.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3><a id="Sales_Budget_81"></a>Sales Budget</h3>
  <p>Target 100% accessibility. The best way to increase accessibility is to have multiple products in a segment. Unlike marketing budgets (which only apply to an individual product’s awareness score), both products’ sales budgets contribute to the segment’s accessibility percentage.</p>
  <p>Individual sensor experiences diminishing returns on a sales budget over $3,000. The overall segment experiences diminishing returns at $4500. Thus with two products, split the sales budget to $2,250 each ($4500 total).</p>
  <p>At 100% accessibility, scale back to $1,560 each ($3,300 total) to maintain 100%</p>
  <h2><a id="Financing_89"></a>Financing</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Maximize long-term debt every round.</li>
    <li>Issue stocks only in the first 2-3 rounds.</li>
    <li>Minimize current assets and liabilities</li>
    <li>Buy back shares with extra cash in the end-game.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3><a id="Goals_96"></a>Goals:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>BETWEEN 1.8 AND 2.8 OF LEVERAGE (Ideally 2.2)</li>
    <li>BETWEEN 30 DAYS AND 90 DAYS OF WORKING CAPITAL (Ideally 60)</li>
    <li>POSITIVE CASH POSITION AT THE END OF THE YEAR (Around 10 Million or more)</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Now, you can get or dump money in 6 places which behave in the following way:</p>
  <p>Issue Stock ($000)</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Decrease Leverage</li>
    <li>Increase Working Capital</li>
    <li>Increase Cash Position</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Retire Stock ($000)</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Increase Leverage</li>
    <li>Decrease Working Capital</li>
    <li>Decrease Cash Position</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Dividend Per Share</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Increase Leverage</li>
    <li>Decrease Working Capital</li>
    <li>Decrease Cash Position</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Current Debt</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Increase Leverage</li>
    <li>Keep Working capital the same</li>
    <li>Increase Cash position</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Issue Long Term Debt ($000)</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Increase Leverage</li>
    <li>Increase Working Capital</li>
    <li>Increase Cash</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Retire Long Term Debt ($000)</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Increase Profits</li>
    <li>Increase Profits</li>
    <li>Decrease Leverage</li>
    <li>Decrease Working Capital</li>
    <li>Decrease Cash</li>
  </ul>
  <h3><a id="Money_Buffer_135"></a>Money Buffer</h3>
  <p>Maintain a buffer as your projection risk goes up, e.g. $5m, $10m, $15m, $20m, and $30m by round 8. Gives you a 10% protection assuming a $300m sales year</p>
  <p>You want to have at least $10,000 in December Cash Position to avoid an Emergency Loan.</p>
  <h1><a id="Plugins_140"></a>Plug-ins</h1>
  <h2><a id="TQM_141"></a>TQM</h2>
  <p>TQM provides lower cost of material, lower cost of labor, faster R&amp;D upgrades, smaller SG&amp;A expense and increased demand for your products. And the effects are cumulative, so all should be maxed as fast as possible.</p>
  <p>Diminishing returns begin at $2000 and TQM is capped at $5000. Thus your TQM investment in each part should be as follows:</p>
  <p>R1: $1500<br>
    R2: $1500<br>
    R3: $1000</p>
    <h2><a id="HR_150"></a>HR</h2>
    <p>Maintain workforce complement at 100% always</p>
    <p>-      HR: 4000 recruiting spend and max (80) training hours<br>
      -      Only HR concerns are the productivity index and turnover rate</p>
      <p>Max out variables to point where diminishing returns begin and hold constant (HR @ $5000 and 80</p>
      <p>Human Resources – You may not know it, but these expenses turn in to savings later on.  Be generous and invest in your people early so you save on labor and productivity later in the game.</p>
      <h2><a id="Labor_Relations_160"></a>Labor Relations</h2>
      <h1><a id="Projections_162"></a>Projections</h1>
      <p>Worst Case Scenario Projection:<br>
        Multiply current market size from the segment analysis page, the growth rate and potential market share.</p>
        <p>These variable can be found in the Potential Market Share and Segment Analysis pages in the Capstone Courier.</p>
        <p>Baseline Projection:<br>
          1.2 is baseline. Multiply against Worst Case Scenario Projection to reach Baseline Projection.</p>
          <p>If your competition is stocking out and mis-projecting, or their products are terrible, push harder with 1.35. If they are more aggressive, stay in the 1.25-1.3 range. At 1.2 you’ll probably stock out. In round 4, you’ll experience a recession, so pull projections back to 1.15/1.10.</p>
          <p>In situations where you three new products are coming on-line, push projections past potential market share, e.g. 1.3/1.4. You’ll probably experience stock-outs. When the market settles and you’ve stopped taking market share, return to 1.15/1.20 production schedule.</p>
          <p>Note that new products will cannibalize old products by about 2% - you can scale back old production by 2% to compensate.</p>
          <h3><a id="Sales_Forecasting_177"></a>Sales Forecasting:</h3>
          <p>Ignore the computer sales forecast. It does account for other team’s actions.</p>
          <p>Demand is driven by customer survey score. The higher the score, the higher demand/</p>
          <h3><a id="Basic_Formula_182"></a>Basic Formula</h3>
          <p>Forecast for Next Year = Last Year Demand * Growth Rate * Last Year’s Market Share</p>
          <p>This assumes no change in your market share.</p>
          <h3><a id="Situation_Analysis_187"></a>Situation Analysis</h3>
          <p><a href="http://ww2.capsim.com/PDF/CAPSTONE_SITUATION_ANALYSIS.PDF">http://ww2.capsim.com/PDF/CAPSTONE_SITUATION_ANALYSIS.PDF</a></p>
          <p>Look at what the market actually sold the previous round, multiply it by 1.078, divide by number of players in the market, and multiply that by 1.2.</p>
          <p>Note the projections need to account for marketshare in future rounds. For instance, if you end up with 35 percent marketshare, then assume 35 percent of the market belongs to you, times 1.2. Always make sure your R&amp;D, sales, marketing, TQM, etc are on-point. That plus introducing new products will win you each segment</p>
          <h1><a id="Scoring_194"></a>Scoring</h1>
          <p>At each round, keep an eye on Balanced score card proforma. Your target in each round can be</p>
          <p>Rounds 1-3 : 40+<br>
            Rounds 4-6: 70+<br>
            Rounds 7-8: 85+</p>
            <p>It’s better to have a little inventory costs than stocking out. You lose more points by not satisfying demand.</p>
            <h1><a id="Round_by_Round_Play_203"></a>Round by Round Play</h1>
            <h2><a id="Round_1_204"></a>Round 1</h2>
            <ol>
              <li>Get as much “Issue Stock” as possible</li>
              <li>Get as much “Issue Long Term Debt”</li>
              <li>Get whatever you need left from “Borrow”</li>
              <li>Raise Low-end Automation to 8 or 9. Move to 10 by round 2.</li>
              <li>Invest $1500 in TQM.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3><a id="Pricing_211"></a>Pricing</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Traditional at $29.5</li>
              <li>Low End at $21</li>
              <li>High End at $39.50</li>
              <li>Performance and Size at $34.50</li>
            </ul>
            <h3><a id="Promotion_217"></a>Promotion</h3>
            <p>Low-end: 2000<br>
              High end: 1000-1500</p>
              <h2><a id="Round_3_221"></a>Round 3</h2>
              <p>New products primarily rob marketshare from your competitors, while cannibalizing only two percent of your own. Introduce new product in all three higher end categories, ignoring Trad and Low due to costs associated with warehouse capacity and automation. The products will takes 2-3 rounds to take root, but will then easily take over one-third to half of the market in each segment.</p>
              <h3><a id="Portfolio_should_be_as_follows_224"></a>Portfolio should be as follows:</h3>
              <p>Traditional: 1 product<br>
                Low-end: 1 product<br>
                High-end: 2 products<br>
                Performance: 2 products<br>
                Size: 2 products</p>
                <p>Note: You are limited to a total of 8 products.</p>
                <p>##End-game Goals<br>
                  Traditional should be near the 8-8.5 automation range, low end 10 towards the end of the game, and the high end offerings can be anywhere from 6-8, depending on how you R&amp;D.</p>
                  <p>Push hard on dividend and share buyback to finish the game with a really high price</p>


              <h1><a id="Strategy_in_Summary_239"></a>Strategy in Summary</h1>
                <br>  <ol>
                    <li>Borrow aggressively, focusing on maximizing long-term debt and issuing stocks
                      <ol>
                        <li>Student competition can be expected to be timid with borrowing in the early stages due:
                          <ol>
                            <li>Inexperience with the real value of debt as investment</li>
                            <li>Safe play encouraged by the presentation of the competition</li>
                            <li>Ethical hesitation with aggressive play due to zero-sum nature of game tied to grades</li>
                            <li>High time preference biases against early loss for later gains</li>
                            <li>Psychological trauma associated with student loans</li>
                          </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>Aggression from Round 0 provides early advantage that will compound intensively after a Round 1 loss.</li>
                        <li>Long-term debt expires in 10 years, but the simulation ends at round 8, such that the only payment you experience is interest. Thus, long-term debt is extremely safe financing and should be maximized every round.</li>
                        <li>Issuing stock is the second best financing. While it lowers stock value, a scoring metric, in early rounds it should be maximized in order to provide working capital that gives an edge on the competition. In the end-game, push hard on dividend and share buyback to raise your stock price above the competition.</li>
                      </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>Focus on high end products (High-end, Performance, Size), automate and defocus low end products (Low-end, Traditional)
                      <ol>
                        <li>Low-end is limited by automation and capacity requirements and a low margin of profit; Traditional is profitable but most competitive
                          <ol>
                            <li>Low end can effectively take the lowest MTBF possible</li>
                            <li>Automation should target Low-end at 10 and Traditional at 9</li>

                        <li>Introducing a new product only cannibalizes 2% of your existing product sales (which can be accounted for by scaling back production) while robbing the competition of a large portion of their market share
                          <ol>
                            <li>Makes strong use of early edge from maximized investment before other teams copy the strategy</li>
                            <li>Achieving domination cripples the competition’s cash flows, making it extremely difficult to play catch-up</li>

                        <li>Aim for 30-50$ market share in each segment</li>
                        <li>Low-end is not focused due to diminishing returns - automation suffices</li>
                      </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>Emphasize accurate sales forecasting

                        <li>TQM provides many benefits which compound</li>
                        <li>Should be maximized ($5000) as soon as possible</li>
                        <li>Diminishing returns at $1000 per round</li>
                        <li>Thus, TQM investment in all categories should be as folllows:

  Beating Capsim Simulation: Master Guide
</header>
<hr>
<p>This guide is a synthesis of all the worthwhile material floating around the net, paired with my own insights, on Capsim's Capstone competition, and the guidebook my team followed to dominate our 2018 undergraduate class with a $620mil lead, crippling 2 teams into bankruptcy, with 1 limping at break-even and second place trailing far behind at $30m. Needless to say, the class curve was brutal.</p>

<p>Be advised, this isn't a cheat code to beating the game. You're not playing against computers. Introducing other players to the game puts it on a level of complexity no AI could follow. Just like Hold 'em, there is Basic Perfect Strategy you can (and should) learn teaching correct odds that'll grant you a mechanical edge over suckers, but to win consistently you need to learn the in's and out's of the game AND your opponents - how to read them, how to respond to them, how to out-maneuver them. Predicting your opponent is a sport that relies more on intuition than math. And no plan survives contact with the enemy.</p>

<p>That said, this will you give you a strong edge, provide you a solid framework and teach you the mindset you need to be in to dominate your class. I've heard some people think it's unfair to use guides like this. Those people should drop out of the program. There is no fair in business, and we all had access to the same resources anyway. Business is war and you have no business jumping in the fray if you don't understand that. You'll get eaten alive. Uni will baby them through their program but they pay for it spades the moment the rubber hits the road. We taught a valuable lesson to the rest of our class. Hopefully they took notes. If you've found yourself here, it means you knew to perform basic due diligence - this is market research - and chances are, your opponents haven't. So let's see some blood.</p>


<p>Basic introduction to Capstone System</p>

<p>TOC</p>

  <h2><a id="Principles_0"></a>Principles</h2>
  <ol>

    <li>Stay consistent. Develop a strategy and stick with it.</li>
    <li>Invest early, profit later. Early investment produces compounded returns.</li>
       <li>Aim for domination. Take over the market by grabbing multiple segments, choking revenue from other teams.</li>
    <li>Borrow aggressively. Students are timid with debt because they don't understand it, but businesses need investment to generate value. </li>
        <li>Pay attention to the competition. Try to identify their strategy and predict their movements so you can adjust accordingly and forecast accurately.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
Read and re-read the provided Team Members Guide. All essential information is provided. You'll be surprised how many dumb mistakes are made because teams overlooked something in the manual. Call the 1-800 number for any clarifications, they're very helpful. Review my notes on it here.</p>

<p>Read and understand the generated Industry Conditions report at the beginning of the simulation. These detail all the conditions of your class's unique simulation and market. I recommend transferring the information into an easily referenced spreadsheet:</p>

  <h2><a id="Rules_of_Thumb_9"></a>Rules of Thumb</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Long-term loans are better than short term loans. Long-term debts expire after 10 years, while the simulation ends at 8; you only pay interest on long-term debts.</li>
    <li>Be careful of emergency loans and spending too much at once. Leave yourself a small buffer - but don’t just sit on cash; reinvest most of it. 10% of Sales.</li>
    <li>It’s better to have a little inventory costs than stocking out. You lose more points and profit by not satisfying demand.</li>
    <li>Pay attention to any time Potential Market Share does not match Actual. Potential will be higher than Actual if you stock-out, meaning you should increase CAP, but can also be lower if other players stock out such that you steal their sales. In that case, don't be overconfident, unless you can see their next round CAP will continue to undershoot their PMS.</li>
    <li>Survey Score is a direct reflection of demand.</li>
        <li>Introducing a new product sees 10-15% market share in the first round, while only eating 2-3% of your existing product's sales.</li>
    <li>Aim for 100% Accessibility and 100% Awareness on every product.</li>
    <li>The computer forecast is useless, it doesn't simulate any competitor actions. Use the <a href="">Worst Case/Best Case formula</a>a>.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2><a id="Recommended_Team_Breakdown_16"></a>Recommended Team Breakdown</h2>
  <p>The book and our professor advisesd splitting the team up by department: R&D, Marketing, Production, Finance. Don't do this, some things are deeply tied together and will result in mishaps if you aren't communicating perfectly. For example, the production forecast requires the sales forecast - they should both be handled by the same person. There should be a leader that has an overall view of the strategy to make review that all the parts are working together. If your team is wary of risking their grade on a dictatorship, do a vote at mid-game whether or not to replace the CEO.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>CEO: overview of all departments, final decision maker</li>
    <li>Marketing Manager: Sales &amp Production Forecasting; Price, Promo & Sales</li>
    <li>Product Manager: Capacity &amp; Automation investment; R&amp;D positioning</li>
    <li>Competitive Intelligence Officer: Analyzing & predicting competition's behavior &amp; strategy</li>
    <li>Financial Analyst: Operating financial controls to maintain leverage; Investment management</li>
  </ol>


      <h2><a id="Projections_162"></a>Forecasting Formulae</h2>
      <p>Use <b>Worst Case Forecast</b> for your Sales Projection, and <b>Best Case Forecast</b> for your Production Schedule. Your financial estimates will be conservative but your production estimates will be optimistic, minimizing stock-outs or emergency loans.</p>

      <h3>Worst Case Forecast:</h3>
      <p><b>CURRENT MARKET SIZE</b> X <b>MARKET GROWTH RATE</b> X <b>POTENTIAL MARKET SHARE</b></p>
        <p>CMS and MGR can be found on the in the Segment Analysis pages of the Courier Report (pg. 5-9). PMS for all products can be found in Market Share page (pg. 10).</p>

        <h3>Best Case Forecast:<h3>
          <p><b>WORST CASE FORECAST</b> X <b>BASELINE PROJECTION</b></p>
          <p>
          <p>1.2 is baseline. If your competition is stocking out and mis-projecting, or their products are terrible, push harder, e.g. 1.35. If they are more aggressive, stay in the 1.2-1.3 range. At 1.15 you’ll probably stock out.</p>

          <p>Note that new products will cannibalize old products by about 2% - you can scale back old production by 2% to compensate.</p>

          <h3>Recession</h3>
          <p>Some games feature a recession in round 3 or 4. Keep an eye on the market growth rates, if there's a sudden drop then you should pull back projections to 1.15/1.10.</p>


  <h2><a id="Marketing_62"></a>Marketing: Prices</h2>
  <h3>Traditional</h3>
  <p>Traditional places the most survey value on price. You want to start your pricing as close as your competition, undercut if possible. If high demand is leading to overproduction, evaluate if raising the price in exchange for less sales would turn more profit.</p>

  <h3>Low End</h3>
  <p>Low End also places high value on price, but even moreso on age. You have to have the lowest price you can afford without going below 40% in your contribution margin, and without sacrificing demand. As your age increases towards the ideal, your demand will increase - if this leads you to stocking out, raise the price.</p>

  <h3>HE Products</h3>
  <p>Price is unimportant for the High End products. For high end, performance and size segments, place your price at the max of their value range. Don't forget to lower them each round as consumer taste drifts.</p>
  
  <h2><a id="Marketing_Budget_71"></a>Marketing: Sales &amp; Promotion</h2>
  <h3>Promotion</h3>
  <p>Target 100% awareness. Keep marketing pushed high until you hit it, then lower to maintenace level.</p>
  <p>$2000 is the promotions sweet spot. After $2000 you hit diminishing returns.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Round when the product is launched – $1700</li>
    <li>Subsequent rounds till awareness reaches 100% –  $2000</li>
    <li>After awareness reaches 100% – $1400 to maintain.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3><a id="Sales_Budget_81"></a>Sales Budget</h3>
  <p>Target 100% accessibility. The best way to increase accessibility is to have multiple products in a segment. Unlike marketing budgets (which only apply to an individual product’s awareness score), both products’ sales budgets contribute to the segment’s accessibility percentage.</p>
  <p>Individual sensor experiences diminishing returns on a sales budget over $3,000. The overall segment experiences diminishing returns at $4500. With one productt, keep sales at $3000, with two products, split the sales budget to $2,250 each ($4500 total).</p>

  <p>At 100% accessibility, scale back to $1,560 each ($3,300 total) to maintain 100%.</p>

  <h2><a id="Financing_89"></a>Financing</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Maximize long-term debt every round.</li>
    <li>Issue stocks if necessary only in the first 2-3 rounds.</li>
    <li>Minimize current assets and liabilities</li>
    <li>Buy back shares with extra cash in the end-game.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3><a id="Goals_96"></a>Goals:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>BETWEEN 1.8 AND 2.8 OF LEVERAGE (Ideally 2.2)</li>
    <li>BETWEEN 30 DAYS AND 90 DAYS OF WORKING CAPITAL (Ideally 60)</li>
    <li>POSITIVE CASH POSITION AT THE END OF THE YEAR (Around 10 Million or more)</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Acquire or dump money in 6 places which behave in the following way:</p>
  <p>Issue Stock ($000)</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Decrease Leverage</li>
    <li>Increase Working Capital</li>
    <li>Increase Cash Position</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Retire Stock ($000)</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Increase Leverage</li>
    <li>Decrease Working Capital</li>
    <li>Decrease Cash Position</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Dividend Per Share</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Increase Leverage</li>
    <li>Decrease Working Capital</li>
    <li>Decrease Cash Position</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Current Debt</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Increase Leverage</li>
    <li>Keep Working capital the same</li>
    <li>Increase Cash position</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Issue Long Term Debt ($000)</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Increase Leverage</li>
    <li>Increase Working Capital</li>
    <li>Increase Cash</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Retire Long Term Debt ($000)</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Increase Profits</li>
    <li>Increase Profits</li>
    <li>Decrease Leverage</li>
    <li>Decrease Working Capital</li>
    <li>Decrease Cash</li>
  </ul>
 

<h3>Debt Investment</h3>
<p>Long-term Debt is the best debt to take out. It's due at Year 10, after the simulation ends; you only ever have to pay for interest. There's little consequence to taking out max LTD every round to finance any investment you need.</p>
<p>Current Debt is due immediately in the following round. It has lower interest rates than LTD, but LTD is never due, so it should only be employed if you've already maxed LTD issue that round.</p>
<p>Issuing stock is a less costly alternative to CTD, and the stock can be rebought in later rounds. However, it is more risky and will lower your market cap, which can hurt your final score.</p>

 <h3><a id="Money_Buffer_135"></a>Cash Buffer</h3>
  <p>In the finance tab, you'll see a December Cash Position estimate. This should always be at least 10% of total sales, and never below $10,000 to avoid risking a crippling Emergency Loan. After you've completed all your decisions, if your expenditure places you below the target then take out debt investment to maintain a safe position.</p>

  <h3>Share Buyback</h3>
  <p>Towards the end of the game, invest excess cash in Stock buyback to increase your stock price. Dividends only effect score in the following two rounds; issue them in R7 and R8 to dress up your final score.</p>


    <h2><a id="Research__Development_25"></a>Research &amp; Development</h2>
  <p>Review the Industry Conditions Report to know the ideal values for the Size, Performance, MTBF and Age criteria for every product.
<p>Make sure to factor each HE product's unique product drift and ideal spot offset to identify the best positioning. You can use this template as an example.</p>



  <h3><a id=""></a>Positioning</h3>
  <p>Positioning (Performance, Size) is essential to a good survey score for the 3 High End products. They should be R&D'd every round.</p>

    <p>Positioning is unimportant for Low End and Traditional as long as you stay in the circle of desirability. R&amp;D should only be done to adjust the age of the product, or when it's reaching the boundaries of the circle.</p>

        <p>Any adjustment in Size or Performance halves the age of the product; adjusting MTBF has no effect. Material production costs rise as your product becomes more advanced than the ideal spot.</p>


  <h3><a id="MBTF_33"></a>MBTF</h3>
  <p>Raise MBTF for every product to their max on the first round and leave it there. The cost and time is very cheap, so there's no reason not to, even if the effect on Low End/Traditional survey score is minimal.</p>

  <h3><a id="Upgrade_Timing_36"></a>Upgrade Timing</h3>
  <p>Sensors will continue to produce and sell at the old specifications up until the project completes (revision date). Unsold sensors built prior to the revision date are then reworked immediately free of charge to match the upgraded specifications.</p>

  <p>Keep product R&amp;D upgrades within the same year or you will miss out on sales. The ideal date to aim for is the very end of Q2: June 28. You want to increase performance and reduce size as much as possible for every HE product before the revision date hits June 28, so you can enjoy Q3 and Q4 sales of the upgraded product.</p>

    <p>Note that after full TQM investment, your time to R&amp;D is reduced by 47%. This will give you a great advantage over teams that don't invest in TQM, and allow more automation in HE.</p>

  <h3><a id="New_Products_59"></a>New Products</h3>
  <p>Introduce a new product every round in high end, performance, and size starting round 3. New products rob your opponents of market share and increase accessibility, allowing you to easily dominate with ~40% market share in uncrowded segments.</p>

 <p>End-game Portfolio should be as follows:</p>
              <p>Traditional: 1 product<br>
                Low-end: 1 product<br>
                High-end: 2 products<br>
                Performance: 2 products<br>
                Size: 2 products</p>

                <p>Note: You are limited to a total of 8 products.</p>

  <h2><a id="Production_41"></a>Production</h2>
  <p>Use the <a href="">Best Case Forecast</a> to fill in the production schedule each round. Every round try to max out your capital investment with capacity or automation, using financing from long-term debt.</p>
    <h3><a id="BuySell_Capacity_54"></a>Buy/Sell Capacity</h3>
  <p>You can produce double your capacity through overtime production at the expense of a greatly increased contribution margin.</p>
  <p>As a rule of thumb, 2nd-shift capacity should be kept between 20-50%. If it's above 50%, buy more capacity. If it is under 20%, sell capacity.</p>

  <h3><a id="Automation_47"></a>Automation</h3>
  <p>Automation is costly and greatly increases the time for R&amp;D, but lowers the cost of production, increasing your contribution margin. Focus on automating Low End and Traditional as soon as possible:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Low End: you want to reach 10 as soon as possible (first round you can move to 8 or 9, and make sure you have 10 by the 2nd round)</li>
    <li>Traditional: increase automation by 2 points each round until you reach 10</li>
    <li>High End: increase by 0.5 or 1 point each round, you do not want to go over 6.</li>
    <li>Performance: increase by 1 or 1.5 each round, until you reach 7</li>
    <li>Size: increase by 0.5 or 1 point each round, until you reach 7</li>
  </ul>


  <h1><a id="Plugins_140"></a>Plug-ins</h1>
  <h2><a id="TQM_141"></a>TQM</h2>
  <p>Total Quality Management provides lower cost of material, lower cost of labor, faster R&amp;D upgrades, smaller SG&amp;A expense and increased demand for your products. And the effects are cumulative, so all should be maxed as fast as possible. TQM usually opens up in Round 3 and can be finished in 3 rounds.</p>
  <p>Diminishing returns begin at $1000 and TQM is capped at $4000. Thus your TQM investment in each part should be as follows:</p>
  <p>R1: $1500<br>
    R2: $1500<br>
    R3: $1000</p>
    <h2><a id="HR_150"></a>HR</h2>
          <p>Human Resources expenses turn into savings later on and raise your final score. Keep everything at maximum:</p>
    <p>Workforce complement: 100%<br>
    HR: 4000 recruiting spend<br>
      Training Hours: 80</p>


          <h1><a id="Scoring_194"></a>Scoring</h1>
          <p>At each round, keep an eye on Balanced score card proforma. Your target in each round should be:</p>
          <p>Rounds 1-3: 40+<br>
            Rounds 4-6: 70+<br>
            Rounds 7-8: 85+</p>


              <h1><a id="Strategy_in_Summary_239"></a>Strategy in Summary</h1>
                <br>  <ol>
                    <li>Borrow aggressively, focusing on maximizing long-term debt and issuing stocks
                      <ol>
                        <li>Student competition can be expected to be timid with borrowing in the early stages due:
                          <ol>
                            <li>Inexperience with the real value of debt as investment</li>
                            <li>Safe play encouraged by the presentation of the competition</li>
                            <li>Ethical hesitation with aggressive play due to zero-sum nature of game tied to grades</li>
                            <li>High time preference biases against early loss for later gains</li>
                            <li>Psychological trauma associated with student loans</li>
                          </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>Aggression from Round 0 provides early advantage that will compound intensively after a Round 1 loss.</li>
                        <li>Long-term debt expires in 10 years, but the simulation ends at round 8, such that the only payment you experience is interest. Thus, long-term debt is extremely safe financing and should be maximized every round.</li>
                        <li>Issuing stock is the second best financing. While it lowers stock value, a scoring metric, in early rounds it should be maximized in order to provide working capital that gives an edge on the competition. In the end-game, push hard on dividend and share buyback to raise your stock price above the competition.</li>
                      </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>Focus on high end products (High-end, Performance, Size), automate and defocus low end products (Low-end, Traditional)
                      <ol>
                        <li>Low-end is limited by automation and capacity requirements and a low margin of profit; Traditional is profitable but most competitive
                          <ol>
                            <li>Automation should target Low-end at 10 and Traditional at 9</li>

                            <li>Makes strong use of early edge from maximized investment before other teams copy the strategy</li>
                            <li>Achieving domination cripples the competition’s cash flows, making it extremely difficult to play catch-up</li>
                            <li>Strangles safe teams attempting to isolate a niche</li>

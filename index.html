  Beating Capsim Simulation: Master Guide
</header>
<hr>
<p>This guide is a synthesis of all the worthwhile material floating around the net, paired with my own insights, on Capsim's Capstone competition, and the guidebook my team followed to dominate our 2019 undergraduate class with end round $576M sales, $87M profit, $264M cumulative profit and $564M market cap, having crippled 2 teams into bankruptcy, with third and second place trailing far behind at $109M, $140M cum. profit, $325M, $369M market cap respectively.</p>

<p>I've heard some people say it's unfair to use guides like this. Those people should drop out of the program. We all have access to the same resources, the only difference is some people lack the agency to make use of them. How far will that get them after uni? We taught a valuable lesson to the rest of our class. Hopefully they took notes.</p>

<p>Be advised, this isn't a cheat code to beating the game. You're not playing against computers. There's no list of inputs that will give you an automatic victory, human players are too unpredictable for that. You still need to learn the in's and out's of the game, and of your opponents - how to read them, how to respond to them, how to out-maneuver them. That said, this will you give you a strong edge, provide you a solid framework and teach you the mindset you need to dominate your class. If you've found yourself here, it means you knew to perform basic due diligence - this is market research - and chances are, your opponents haven't. So let's see some blood.</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h2 id="docs">Capsim Documents</h2>
<h3>Team Member's Guide</h3>
  <p>
Before doing anything, read and re-read the provided Team Members Guide. All essential information is provided. You'll be surprised how many dumb mistakes are made because teams overlooked something in the manual (if they ever opened it). And call the 1-800 number for any clarifications, they're very helpful.</p>

<h3 id="industry_report">Industry Conditions Report</h3>
<p>An Industry Conditions report is generated at the beginning of every simulation, containing all the random conditions setup for your class's game. I recommend transferring the information into an easily referenced spreadsheet, e.g.:</p>

<figure><a href="industry_report.png">

<p>You can grab my template <a href="">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Courier Report</h3>
<p>The Courier Report is published at the end of each round showing the results for the year. Study this to evaluate your own performance as well as your competitor's.</p>


  <h2><a id="team_breakdown"></a>Recommended Team Breakdown</h2>
<p>
    Ignore the guide's advice to split the team by department (R&D, Marketing, Production, Finance). The different tasks are too interwined to split up like that, any miscommunication will result in serious losses. There needs to be one leader reviewing everyone and ensuring all the parts are working together before the final decision are submit.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>CEO/Finance: overview of all departments, final decision maker; financing and investment management</li>
    <li>Marketing Manager: Sales &amp; Production Forecasting; Price, Promo & Sales</li>
    <li>Product Manager: R&amp;D positioning; Capacity &amp; Automation investment</li>
    <li>Competitive Intelligence Officer: Analyzing & predicting competition's behavior &amp; strategy</li>
  </ol>

<p>If your team is wary of risking their grade on a dictatorship, allow the CEO to be put to a vote at mid-game to be replaced if he's performing badly.</p>


  <h2><a id="#principles"></a>Basic Principles</h2>
  <ol>

    <li>Borrow aggressively. Students are timid with debt because they don't understand it, but businesses need investment to generate value. </li>
    <li>Aim for domination. Introduce new products to take over high end segments, choking revenue from other teams.</li>
    <li>Invest early, profit later. Early investment produces compounded returns.</li>
    <li>Pay attention to competition. Try to identify their strategy and predict their movements so you can adjust accordingly and forecast accurately.</li>
  </ol>

   <h2><a id="rules"></a>Rules of Thumb</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Long-term debt is better than current debt. Long-term debts expire after 10 years, while the simulation ends at 8; you only pay interest on long-term debts.</li>
    <li>Be careful of emergency loans and spending too much at once. Leave yourself a 10% of sales cash buffer - but don’t just sit on cash; reinvest most of it.</li>
    <li>It’s better to have a little inventory costs than stocking out. You lose more points and profit by not satisfying demand.</li>
    <li>Customer Survey Score is a direct reflection of demand.</li>
    <li>Pay attention any time Potential Market Share doesn't match Actual. PMS < AMS means you're CAP is too low; AMS > PMS means other players are stocking out, leading to stolen sales.</li>
    <li>Aim for 100% Accessibility and 100% Awareness on every product.</li>
    <li>The computer sales forecast is useless, always use the <a href="#projections">Worst Case/Best Case formula</a> instead.</li>
    <li>Wait until TQM before seriously automating High End products due to reduction in R&amp;D revision date.</li>
            <li>A newly introduced product sees 10-15% market share in the first round, while only eating 2-3% of your existing product's sales.</li>
  </ol>


 
      <h2><a id="projections"></a>Forecasting Formulae</h2>
      <p>Use <b>Worst Case Forecast</b> for your Sales Projection, and <b>Best Case Forecast</b> for your Production Schedule. Your financial estimates will be conservative but your production estimates will be optimistic, minimizing stock-outs or emergency loans.</p>

      <h3>Worst Case Forecast:</h3>
      <p><strong>CURRENT MARKET SIZE</strong> X <strong>MARKET GROWTH RATE</strong> X <strong>POTENTIAL MARKET SHARE</strong></p>
        <p>CMS and MGR can be found on the in the Segment Analysis pages of the Courier Report (pg. 5-9). PMS for all products can be found in Market Share page (pg. 10).</p>

        <h3>Best Case Forecast:</h3>
          <p><strong>WORST CASE FORECAST</strong> X <strong>BUFFER VALUE</strong></p>
          <p>You're simply multiplying the worst case forecast with a % buffer.</p>
          <p>1.2 is baseline buffer value. If your competition is stocking out and mis-projecting, or their products are terrible, push harder, e.g. 1.35. If they are more aggressive, stay in the 1.2-1.3 range. At 1.15 you’ll probably stock out.</p>

          <p>Note that new products will cannibalize old products by about 2% - you can scale back old production by 2% to compensate.</p>

          <h3>Recession</h3>
          <p>Some games feature a recession in round 3 or 4. Keep an eye on the market growth rates, if there's a sudden drop then you should pull back projections to 1.15/1.10.</p>

        <h3 id="production_schedule">Production Schedule</h3>
        <p><strong>BEST CASE FORECAST</strong> - <strong>LEFTOVER INVENTORY</strong></p>
        <p>This is exactly how much you should produce each round.</p>


    <h2><a id="rnd"></a>Research &amp; Development</h2>
  <p>Review the Industry Conditions Report to know the ideal values for the Size, Performance, MTBF and Age criteria for every product.</p>
<p>Make sure to factor each HE product's unique product drift and ideal spot offset to identify the best positioning. You can use this template as an example.</p>

        <p>Note: Any adjustment in Size or Performance halves the age of the product; adjusting MTBF has no effect. Material production costs rise as your product becomes more advanced than the ideal spot.</p>


  <h3><a id=""></a>Positioning</h3>
      <p>Positioning is unimportant for Low End and Traditional as long as you stay in the circle of desirability. R&amp;D should only be done to adjust the age of the product, or when it's reaching the boundaries of the circle.</p>

  <p>Positioning (Performance, Size) is essential for the 3 High End products. They should be R&D'd every round and kept as close to the ideal spot as possible.</p>

  <h3><a id="MBTF_33"></a>MBTF</h3>
  <p>Raise MBTF for every product to their max on the first round and leave it there. The cost and time is very cheap, so there's no reason not to, even if the effect on Low End/Traditional survey score is minimal.</p>

  <h3><a id="Upgrade_Timing_36"></a>Upgrade Timing</h3>
  <p>Sensors will continue to produce and sell at the old specifications up until the project completes (revision date). Unsold sensors built prior to the revision date are then reworked immediately free of charge to match the upgraded specifications.</p>

  <p>Keep product R&amp;D upgrades within the same year or you will miss out on sales. The ideal date to aim for is the very end of Q2: June 28. You want to increase performance and reduce size as much as possible for every HE product before the revision date hits June 28, so you can enjoy Q3 and Q4 sales of the upgraded product.</p>

    <p>Note that after full TQM investment, your time to R&amp;D is reduced by 47%. This will give you a great advantage over teams that don't invest in TQM, and allow more automation in HE.</p>

  <h3><a id="New_Products_59"></a>New Products</h3>
  <p>Introduce a new product every round in high end, performance, and size starting round 3. New products rob your opponents of market share and increase accessibility, allowing you to easily dominate with ~40% market share in uncrowded segments.</p>

 <p>End-game Portfolio should be as follows:</p>
              <p>Traditional: 1 product<br>
                Low-end: 1 product<br>
                High-end: 2 products<br>
                Performance: 2 products<br>
                Size: 2 products</p>

                <p>Note: You are limited to a total of 8 products.</p>

  <h2><a id="production"></a>Production</h2>
  <p>Use the <a href="#projections">Production Schedule</a> forecast to fill in the production schedule each round. Every round try to max out your capital investment with capacity or automation, using financing from long-term debt.</p>
    <h3><a id="BuySell_Capacity_54"></a>Buy/Sell Capacity</h3>
  <p>You can produce double your capacity through overtime production at the expense of a greatly increased contribution margin.</p>
  <p>As a rule of thumb, 2nd-shift capacity should be kept between 20-50%. If it's above 50%, buy more capacity. If it is under 20%, sell capacity.</p>

  <h3><a id="Automation_47"></a>Automation</h3>
  <p>Automation is costly and increases the time for R&amp;D, but lowers the cost of production, increasing your contribution margin. Focus on automating Low End and Traditional as soon as possible, only slowly increase High End.</p>

<figure><a href="automation.png">
  <img src="automation.png" alt="Recommended Automation Schedule" /></a>
  <figcaption>Recommended Automation Schedule
  </figcaption>
</figure>

  <p>Never sell automation, it costs money due to having to retool the factory.

  <h2><a id="marketing_prices"></a>Marketing: Prices</h2>
  <h3>Traditional</h3>
  <p>Traditional places the most survey value on price. You want to start your pricing as close as your competition, undercut if possible. If high demand is leading to overproduction, evaluate if raising the price in exchange for less sales would turn more profit.</p>

  <h3>Low End</h3>
  <p>Low End also places high value on price, but even moreso on age. You have to have the lowest price you can afford without going below 40% in your contribution margin, and without sacrificing demand. As your age increases towards the ideal, your demand will increase - if this leads you to stocking out, raise the price.</p>

  <h3>HE Products</h3>
  <p>Price is unimportant for the High End products. For high end, performance and size segments, place your price at the max of their value range. Don't forget to lower them each round as consumer taste drifts.</p>
  
  <h2><a id="marketing_sales"></a>Marketing: Sales &amp; Promotion</h2>
  <h3>Promotion</h3>
  <p>Target 100% awareness. Keep marketing pushed high until you hit it, then lower to maintenace level.</p>
  <p>$2000 is the promotions sweet spot. After $2000 you hit diminishing returns.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Round when the product is launched – $1700</li>
    <li>Subsequent rounds till awareness reaches 100% –  $2000</li>
    <li>After awareness reaches 100% – $1400 to maintain.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3><a id="Sales_Budget_81"></a>Sales Budget</h3>
  <p>Target 100% accessibility. The best way to increase accessibility is to have multiple products in a segment. Unlike marketing budgets (which only apply to an individual product’s awareness score), both products’ sales budgets contribute to the segment’s accessibility percentage.</p>
  <p>Individual sensor experiences diminishing returns on a sales budget over $3,000. The overall segment experiences diminishing returns at $4500. With one productt, keep sales at $3000, with two products, split the sales budget to $2,250 each ($4500 total).</p>

  <p>At 100% accessibility, scale back to $1,560 each ($3,300 total) to maintain 100%.</p>

  <h2><a id="finance"></a>Finance</h2>
  <p>Finance should be done last. After all investment decisions are made, financing should be acquired to fund them or the investments should be scaled back if not enough funds can be found.


  <h3><a id="Goals_96"></a>Financial Levers:</h3>
  <p>Finance is all about balancing leverage, working capital and cash position. The ideal range:
  <ol>
    <li>BETWEEN 1.8 AND 2.8 OF LEVERAGE (Ideally 2.2)</li>
    <li>BETWEEN 30 DAYS AND 90 DAYS OF WORKING CAPITAL (Ideally 60)</li>
    <li>POSITIVE CASH POSITION AT THE END OF THE YEAR (10%< Sales)</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Acquire or dump money in 6 places to manipulate these numbers:</p>

  </ul>
 -->

<h3>Debt Investment</h3>
<p>Long-term Debt is the best debt to take out. It's due at Year 10, after the simulation ends; you only ever have to pay for interest. There's little consequence to taking out max LTD every round to finance any investment you need.</p>
<p>Current Debt is due immediately in the following round. It has lower interest rates than LTD, but LTD is never due, so it should only be employed if you've already maxed LTD issue that round.</p>
<p>Issuing stock is a less costly alternative to CTD, and the stock can be rebought in later rounds. However, it is more risky and will lower your market cap, which can hurt your final score.</p>

 <h3><a id="Money_Buffer_135"></a>Cash Buffer</h3>
  <p>In the finance tab, you'll see a December Cash Position estimate. This should always be at least 10% of total sales, and never below $10,000 to avoid risking a crippling Emergency Loan. After you've completed all your decisions, if your expenditure places you below the target then take out debt investment to maintain a safe position.</p>

  <h3>Share Buyback</h3>
  <p>Towards the end of the game, invest excess cash in Stock buyback to increase your stock price. Dividends only effect score in the following two rounds; issue them in R7 and R8 to dress up your final score.</p>

 <p>Rules of Thumb:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Maximize long-term debt every round.</li>
    <li>Issue stocks if necessary only in the first 2-3 rounds.</li>
    <li>Minimize current assets and liabilities.</li>
    <li>Buy back shares with extra cash in the end-game.</li>
  </ol>

          <h2><a id="score"></a>Scoring</h2>
          <p>At each round, keep an eye on your Balanced score card proforma. Your target in each round should be:</p>
          <p>Rounds 1-3: 40+<br>
            Rounds 4-6: 70+<br>
            Rounds 7-8: 85+</p>
            <p>Note that some professors may use other metrics, such as Final Score Relative or ending stock price.</p>

  <h2><a id="plugins"></a>Plug-ins: TQM, HR</h2>
  <h3><a id="tqm"></a>TQM</h3>
  <p>Total Quality Management provides lower cost of material, lower cost of labor, faster R&amp;D upgrades, smaller SG&amp;A expense and increased demand for your products. And the effects are cumulative, so all should be maxed as fast as possible. TQM usually opens up in Round 3 and can be finished in 3 rounds.</p>
  <p>Diminishing returns begin at $1500 and TQM is capped at $4000. Thus your TQM investment in each part should be as follows:</p>
  <p>R1: $1500<br>
    R2: $1500<br>
    R3: $1000</p>
    <h3><a id="hr"></a>HR</h3>
          <p>Human Resources expenses turn into savings later on and raise your final score. Keep everything at maximum:</p>
    <p>Workforce complement: 100%<br>
    HR: 4000 recruiting spend<br>
      Training Hours: 80</p>



              <h1><a id="strategy"></a>Strategy in Summary</h1>
                <br>  <ol>
                    <li>Borrow aggressively, focusing on maximizing long-term debt and issuing stocks
                      <ol>
                        <li>Student competition can be expected to be timid with borrowing in the early stages due:
                          <ol>
                            <li>Inexperience with the real value of debt as investment</li>
                            <li>Safe play encouraged by the presentation of the competition</li>
                            <li>Ethical hesitation with aggressive play due to zero-sum nature of game tied to grades</li>
                            <li>High time preference biases against early loss for later gains</li>
                            <li>Psychological trauma associated with student loans</li>
                          </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>Aggression from Round 0 provides early advantage that will compound intensively after a Round 1 loss.</li>
                        <li>Long-term debt expires in 10 years, but the simulation ends at round 8, such that the only payment you experience is interest. Thus, long-term debt is extremely safe financing and should be maximized every round.</li>
                        <li>Issuing stock is the second best financing. While it lowers stock value, a scoring metric, in early rounds it should be maximized in order to provide working capital that gives an edge on the competition. In the end-game, push hard on dividend and share buyback to raise your stock price above the competition.</li>
                      </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>Focus on high end products (High-end, Performance, Size), automate and defocus low end products (Low-end, Traditional)
                      <ol>
                        <li>Low-end is limited by automation and capacity requirements and a low margin of profit; Traditional is profitable but most competitive
                          <ol>
                            <li>Automation should target Low-end at 10 and Traditional at 9</li>
                          </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>High end offers more value
                          <ol>
                            <li>Should closely attempt to match product drift and forecasting each round</li>
                            <li>Automation in high end segments should aim for 6-7</li>
                          </ol>
                        </li>
                      </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>Dominate the market by introducing new products early to High-end segments
                      <ol>
                        <li>Introducing a new product only cannibalizes 2% of your existing product sales (which can be accounted for by scaling back production) while robbing the competition of a large portion of their market share
                          <ol>
                            <li>Makes strong use of early edge from maximized investment before other teams copy the strategy</li>
                            <li>Achieving domination cripples the competition’s cash flows, making it extremely difficult to play catch-up</li>
                            <li>Strangles safe teams attempting to isolate a niche</li>
                          </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>Aim for 40-50% market share in each segment</li>
                        <li>Low-end is not focused due to diminishing returns - automation suffices</li>
                      </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>Emphasize accurate sales forecasting
                      <ol>
                        <li>Computer Prediction does not consider competition - assumes all competitors are providing products with customer survey score of 20</li>
                      </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>Maintain a 10% money buffer to avoid emergency loans</li>
                    <li>Develop TQM rapidly
                      <ol>
                        <li>TQM provides many benefits which compound</li>
                        <li>Should be maximized ($5000) as soon as possible</li>
                        <li>Diminishing returns at $1000 per round</li>
